This folder contains the utility functions that are utilized to perform the computations. Among them are

- [RandOrthMat](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11783-randorthmat) by Ofek Shilon that generates a random orthogonal matrix for a given size (a real square matrix).
 - [saveTightFigure](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48877-savetightfigure-h-outfilename) by Flavio "LeviCC" Capitao to get rid of the white margin in saveas output.
 - [suplabel](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7772-suplabel) by Ben Barrowes to place text as a title, xlabel, or ylabel on a group of subplots.
